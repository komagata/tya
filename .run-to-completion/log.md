# Run To Completion Log

## 2026-04-29 18:40:04 JST

- Started from argument-free run-to-completion invocation.
- Inferred goal from `SELFHOST_WORK.md`: complete the first unchecked
  self-hosting queue item.
- Next milestone: compare stage-1 and stage-2 generated C for deterministic
  output.

## 2026-04-29 18:46:30 JST

- Added repeated stage-2 codegen determinism comparisons to
  `scripts/stage1_selfhost_sources_check.sh`.
- Updated `tests/selfhost_test.go` expected output.
- Focused verification passed: `sh scripts/stage1_selfhost_sources_check.sh`.

## 2026-04-29 18:48:28 JST

- Full verification passed: `go test ./... -count=1`.
- Bootstrap verification passed: `sh scripts/selfhost_bootstrap_check.sh`.

## 2026-04-29 18:49:10 JST

- Committed deterministic stage-2 codegen checkpoint as `ad0ab90`.
- Next queue cleanup: mark parent tasks complete where all children are checked.

## 2026-04-29 18:51:00 JST

- Resumed after `go`.
- Confirmed worktree was clean and `SELFHOST_WORK.md` had no unchecked items.
- Stop condition reached: no queued self-hosting work remains.

## 2026-04-29 18:59:38 JST

- User gave new goal in Japanese: keep iterating development until self-hosting
  works.
- Reopened run-to-completion state for the broader self-host completion goal.
- Seeded `SELFHOST_WORK.md` with a new high-level completion queue based on
  `ROADMAP.md`.

## 2026-04-29 19:00:20 JST

- Promoted completed lexer parity TODOs in `ROADMAP.md`.
- Marked the matching `SELFHOST_WORK.md` queue item done.

## 2026-04-29 19:01:15 JST

- Added self-host parser support for parenthesized one-argument assignment calls
  by lowering `name = call(arg)` to existing `CALL1` nodes.
- Updated `TestSelfhostParserMatchesGoParserSubset` and Go AST summarization.
- Focused verification passed: `go test ./tests -run
  TestSelfhostParserMatchesGoParserSubset -count=1`.

## 2026-04-29 19:05:24 JST

- Focused self-host source check passed: `sh scripts/selfhost_check.sh`.
- Full verification passed: `go test ./... -count=1`.
- Bootstrap verification passed: `sh scripts/selfhost_bootstrap_check.sh`.

## 2026-04-29 19:06:43 JST

- Committed parenthesized one-argument call parser slice as `69e0052`.
- Added self-host parser support for parenthesized two-argument assignment calls
  by lowering `name = call(arg, arg2)` to existing `CALL2` nodes.
- Extended parser subset test with `split(message, "\\n")`.
- Focused verification passed: `go test ./tests -run
  TestSelfhostParserMatchesGoParserSubset -count=1`.

- Committed parenthesized two-argument call parser slice as `701ff4c`.
- Added self-host parser support for parenthesized three-argument assignment
  calls by lowering `name = call(arg, arg2, arg3)` to existing `CALL3` nodes.
- Extended parser subset test with `replace(message, "T", message)`.
- Focused verification passed: `go test ./tests -run
  TestSelfhostParserMatchesGoParserSubset -count=1`.
